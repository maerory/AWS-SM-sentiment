    "# Population Segmentation with SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do **population segmentation**. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **principal component analysis** (PCA) you will reduce the dimensionality of the original census data. Then, you'll use **k-means clustering** to assign each US county to a particular cluster based on where a county lies in component space. How each cluster is arranged in component space can tell you which US counties are most similar and what demographic traits define that similarity; this information is most often used to inform targeted, marketing campaigns that want to appeal to a specific group of people. This cluster information is also useful for learning more about a population by revealing patterns between regions that you otherwise may not have noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using data collected by the [US Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census), which aims to count the US population, recording demographic traits about labor, age, population, and so on, for each county in the US. The bulk of this notebook was taken from an existing SageMaker example notebook and [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-us-census-data-for-population-segmentation-using-amazon-sagemaker/), and I've broken it down further into demonstrations and exercises for you to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement population segmentation, you'll go through a number of steps:\n",
    "* Data loading and exploration\n",
    "* Data cleaning and pre-processing \n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction with PCA\n",
    "* Feature engineering and data transformation\n",
    "* Clustering transformed data with k-means\n",
    "* Extracting trained model attributes and visualizing k clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks make up a complete, machine learning workflow from data loading and cleaning to model deployment. Each exercise is designed to give you practice with part of the machine learning workflow, and to demonstrate how to use SageMaker tools, such as built-in data management with S3 and built-in algorithms.\n",

For higher dimensions, an algorithm like k-means has a difficult time figuring out which features are most important, and the result is, often, noisier clusters.\n",

To decide how many top components to include, it's helpful to look at how much **data variance** the components capture. For our original, high-dimensional data, 34 features captured 100% of our data variance. If we discard some of these higher dimensions, we will lower the amount of variance we can capture.\n",

The below images are taken from the PhD thesis,  [“Approaches to analyse and interpret biological profile data”](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/696) by Matthias Scholz, (2006, University of Potsdam, Germany).\n",

So, we can instead choose to create two new dimensions, made up of linear combinations of the original, three dimensions. These dimensions are represented by the two axes/lines, centered in the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "When we select the top n components to use in a new data model, we'll typically want to include enough components to capture about 80-90% of the original data variance. In this project, we are looking at generalizing over a lot of data and we'll aim for about 80% coverage."

    "### Choosing a \"Good\" K\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for choosing a \"good\" k, is to choose based on empirical data. A bad k would be one so *high* that only one or two very close data points are near it, and another bad k would be one so *low* that data points are really far away from the centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to select a k such that data points in a single cluster are close together but that there are enough clusters to effectively separate the data. You can approximate this separation by measuring how close your data points are to each cluster center; the average centroid distance between cluster points and a centroid. After trying several values for k, the centroid distance typically reaches some \"elbow\"; it stops decreasing at a sharp rate and this indicates a good value of k. The graph below indicates the average centroid distance for value of k between 5 and 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/elbow_graph.png' width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "A distance elbow can be seen around 8 when the distance starts to increase and then decrease at a slower rate. This indicates that there is enough separation to distinguish the data points in each cluster, but also that you included enough clusters so that the data points aren’t *extremely* far away from each cluster."
