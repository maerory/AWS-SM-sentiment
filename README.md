# Machine Learning Deployment using AWS SageMaker

The repository contains code for deploying different ML models using AWS Sagemaker, following intstruction from the Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree from Udacity.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials
* Sentiment Inference (XGB) - Analyze the sentiment from the IMDB movie review dataset using XGBoost model.
* Sentiment Inference (LSTM-PyTorch) - Analyze the sentiment from the IMDB move review dataset using simple LSTM model in PyTorch.
* Population Segmentation (PCA, K-means) - Classify the different counties based on features. The feature dimension is reduced by the PCA algorithm, then, K-means grouping is applied.
* Fraud Detection (Linear Model) - Classify the card usage data as fraud or valid transaction using simple linear model. Fit the model controlling for the precision or recall rates.
